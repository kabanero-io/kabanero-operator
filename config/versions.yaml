# Maps Kabanero platform version to related component versions
# understood by the other operators. 

# Note the following sequence: the Kabanero operator becomes aware
# of a new version of the Kabanero platform, in part by editing this file
# Once the operators are rolled out, the administrator can choose to use
# the new Kabanero version by editing the Kabanero resource. This causes
# other resources to be updated using this mapping

# When the Kabanero instance does not specify which version of Kabanero to use,
# this is the value
default: "0.6.0"

# Top level: relates Kabanero versions to software versions
